# Operand SDK

The official Typescript SDK for the [Operand](https://operand.ai) API. Currently, this SDK only supports
web-based clients, i.e. not Node.js servers. The SDK itself is generated against our [public API](https://buf.build/operand/engine). If you're interested in learning more about this API, please visit [the landing page](https://operand.ai/engine).
